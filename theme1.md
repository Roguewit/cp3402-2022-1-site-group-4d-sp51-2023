## Design decisions

- Clean and Modern Design: The theme was designed with a clean and modern look to appeal
to a broad audience. The design is minimalistic, with a focus on legibility and ease of use.

- Color Scheme: We chose a bold and eye-catching primary color, #046307, to add vibrancy and
energy to the theme. The secondary color, #8ED1FC, provides a strong contrast and adds balance
to the design. The background color, #ffffff, was chosen to provide a neutral and calm backdrop
that allows the content to stand out.

- Typography: We chose a legible and modern sans-serif font for the body text, with a larger and
bolder font for headings and titles. The typography is consistent throughout the theme, providing
a cohesive and professional look.

- Mobile Responsive: The theme is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices. It adjusts
to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring that the content is easily accessible and
readable on all devices.
