Our team was tasked with developing a learning centre platform for a client. To ensure that the project was completed successfully, we needed to implement robust project management practices, effective version control, thorough testing, and automation to streamline the development process.

## Project Management

We established a project management framework that included regular check-ins, clear communication channels, and a well-defined project plan. We also identified key members and set up a schedule for regular updates and feedback sessions. There are six sprint periods that were separated in three weeks. There is a daily standup meeting on the morning of every working day. The platform we use to make sprint plans and track everyoneâ€™s process is Trello board.

1. Project backlog listed every feature that should be done for the whole subject.
2. To do column (sprint plan) listed the tasks that need to be done in the following sprint period.
3. Doing listed which member oversees which task.
4. Done listed closed tasks that are done and well-tested.

## Version Control

We implemented a version control system to track changes to our codebase and ensure that all team members were working on the most up-to-date version. We chose Git as our version control tool and created a shared repository where all team members could access and contribute to the codebase.

## Testing

As we developed the platform, we prioritized testing to ensure that it met the client's requirements and was free of bugs and errors. We used a combination of manual and automated testing to thoroughly test each feature and fix any issues that arose. And invited non-project personnel to assist our testing.
